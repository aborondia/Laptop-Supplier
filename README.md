# Laptop Supplier - [Andrew Borondia](https://cranky-beaver-6bfa9c.netlify.app/projects)

This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.

It was created using C# & ASP.Net MVC that has the basic functionality of an online shop. It allows users to search through a (small, local) database of laptops. Some of the functionalities that are implemented are sorting based on criteria such as price, year, etc., adding/removing brands/laptops from the database, and comparing laptop models.
